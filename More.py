Problem Statement -: Street Lights are installed at every position along a 1-D road of length n. 
Locations[] (an array) represents the coverage limit of these lights.
 The ith light has a coverage limit of locations[i] that can range from the position 
 max((i â€“ locations[i]), 1) to min((i + locations[i]), n ) (Closed intervals). 
 Initially all the lights are switched off. 
 Find the minimum number of fountains that must be switched on to cover the road.

Intervals!
